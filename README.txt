== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the plugin responsive? =

Yes it is!

= Where can I get support? =

Support is provided on deftdev.com. While we do check the WP.org support forum, it is infrequent, so you are best going direct to deftdev.com

= What's the difference between the free version and the Pro version? =

More features! The **[PRO](http://deftdev.com/downloads/resres "deftDEV")** version has more templates, and admin reservation monitor, manual reservations, cancellation system, captcha systems and more!

= Can I use this with [insert name here] theme? =

While we can't guarantee compatibility with every theme out there (there are a lot of them you know!), if it follows WordPress guidelines then it should work with no or minor issues. The only thing that you may need to do is tweak the CSS to match your theme.

= How does the plugin inform me of a reservation? =

It will email you. With the **[PRO](http://deftdev.com/downloads/resres "deftDEV")** version you will also have access to the admin reservation screen to see who has reserved, cancelled and arrived on any given day.
